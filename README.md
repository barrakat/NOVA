## üìç Overview

In this project I compare the performance of the best trained tree seedling detector in Norway by using my own labelled instances (N 530, red quadrants in Figure 1A) from 82 tiled orthomosaics of 10 m size VS the full instances labelled by the whole class group (N 5074, blue quadrants in Figure 1A) from 3065 tiled orthomosaics of the same size (Figure 1C).

I trained 2 different models per instance group, as explained in Running Tests section below, and discuss the obtained performance results in 4 areas in Norway (Figure 1B) (see Results section below).
